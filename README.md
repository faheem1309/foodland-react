## 📖 Background Story

FoodLand was **not built randomly**.

This project was created **on demand** and **under the guidance of my learning mate _Srivalli Yaarlagadda_**, who wanted a clean, modern food landing page that could later evolve into a full-scale food platform.

The goal was simple:
- Practice real-world React structure
- Build reusable UI components
- Maintain clean folder organization
- Deploy a production-ready project

This project represents **learning by building**, not tutorials by copying.

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This Project

- To strengthen **React fundamentals**
- To practice **component-driven architecture**
- To understand **real deployment workflows**
- To convert learning into a **real showcase project**
- To build something **useful, scalable, and presentable**

---

## 🧠 How I Built It

- Planned UI sections first
- Broke the UI into reusable components
- Structured assets, styles, and data cleanly
- Used mock recipe data for scalability
- Ensured responsiveness and clarity
- Deployed using **Vercel**
